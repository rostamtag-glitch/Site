<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong> <br>Welcome to Clarea! The terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Clarea. Clarea operates this store and website, including all related information, content, features, tools, products and services in order to provide you, the customer, with a curated shopping experience (the “Services”). Clarea is powered by Shopify, which enables us to provide the Services to you. <br>The below terms and conditions, together with any policies referenced herein (these “Terms of Service” or “Terms”) describe your rights and responsibilities when you use the Services. <br>Please read these Terms of Service carefully, as they include important information about your legal rights and cover areas such as warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability. <br>By visiting, interacting with or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy [LINK]. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service or Privacy Policy, you should not use or access our Services. <br><br><strong>SECTION 1 - ACCESS AND ACCOUNT</strong> <br>By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or province of residence, and you have given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use the Services on devices you own, purchase or manage. <br>To use the Services, including accessing or browsing our online stores or purchasing any of the products or services we offer, you may be asked to provide certain information, such as your email address, billing, payment, and shipping information. You represent and warrant that all the information you provide in our stores is correct, current and complete and that you have all rights necessary to provide this information. <br>You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and for all of your account activity. You may not transfer, sell, assign, or license your account to any other person. <br><br><strong>SECTION 2 - OUR PRODUCTS</strong> <br>We have made every effort to provide an accurate representation of our products and services in our online stores. However, please note that colors or product appearance may differ from how they may appear on your screen due to the type of device you use to access the store and your device settings and configuration. <br>We do not warrant that the appearance or quality of any products or services purchased by you will meet your expectations or be the same as depicted or rendered in our online stores. <br>All descriptions of products are subject to change at any time without notice at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time and may limit the quantities of any products that we offer to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction, on a case-by-case basis. <br><br><strong>SECTION 3 - ORDERS</strong> <br>When you place an order, you are making an offer to purchase. Clarea reserves the right to accept or decline your order for any reason at its discretion. Your order is not accepted until Clarea confirms acceptance. We must receive and process your payment before your order is accepted. Please review your order carefully before submitting, as Clarea may be unable to accommodate cancellation requests after an order is accepted. In the event that we do not accept, make a change to, or cancel an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting the e‑mail, billing address, and/or phone number provided at the time the order was made. <br>Your purchases are subject to return or exchange solely in accordance with our Refund Policy [LINK]. <br>You represent and warrant that your purchases are for your own personal or household use and not for commercial resale or export. <br><br><strong>SECTION 4 - PRICES AND BILLING</strong> <br>Prices, discounts and promotions are subject to change without notice. The price charged for a product or service will be the price in effect at the time the order is placed and will be set out in your order confirmation email. Unless otherwise expressly stated, posted prices do not include taxes, shipping, handling, customs or import charges. <br>Prices posted in our online stores may be different from prices offered in physical stores or in online or other stores operated by third parties. We may offer, from time to time, promotions on the Services that may affect pricing and that are governed by terms and conditions separate from these Terms. If there is a conflict between the terms for a promotion and these Terms, the promotion terms will govern. <br>You agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase, payment and account information for all purchases made at our stores. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address, credit card numbers and expiration dates, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed. <br>You represent and warrant that (i) the credit card information you provide is true, correct, and complete, (ii) you are duly authorized to use such credit card for the purchase, (iii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company, and (iv) you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including shipping and handling charges and all applicable taxes, if any. <br><br><strong>SECTION 5 - SHIPPING AND DELIVERY</strong> <br>We are not liable for shipping and delivery delays. All delivery times are estimates only and are not guaranteed. We are not responsible for delays caused by shipping carriers, customs processing, or events outside our control. Once we transfer products to the carrier, title and risk of loss passes to you. <br><br><strong>SECTION 6 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</strong> <br>Our Services, including but not limited to all trademarks, brands, text, displays, images, graphics, product reviews, video, and audio, and the design, selection, and arrangement thereof, are owned by Clarea, its affiliates or licensors and are protected by U.S. and foreign patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws. <br>These Terms permit you to use the Services for your personal, non-commercial use only. You must not reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, republish, download, store, or transmit any of the material on the Services without our prior written consent. Except as expressly provided herein, nothing in these Terms grants or shall be construed as granting a license or other rights to you under any patent, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property of Clarea, Shopify or any third party. Unauthorized use of the Services may be a violation of federal and state intellectual property laws. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by Clarea. <br>Clarea’s names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans are trademarks of Clarea or its affiliates or licensors. You must not use such trademarks without the prior written permission of Clarea. Shopify’s name, logo, product and service names, designs and slogans are trademarks of Shopify. All other names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans on the Services are the trademarks of their respective owners. <br><br><strong>SECTION 7 - OPTIONAL TOOLS</strong> <br>You may be provided with access to customer tools offered by third parties as part of the Services, which we neither monitor nor have any control nor input. <br>You acknowledge and agree that we provide access to such tools “as is” and “as available” without any warranties, representations or conditions of any kind and without any endorsement. We shall have no liability whatsoever arising from or relating to your use of optional third-party tools. <br>Any use by you of the optional tools offered through the site is entirely at your own risk and discretion and you should ensure that you are familiar with and approve of the terms on which tools are provided by the relevant third-party provider(s). <br>We may also, in the future, offer new features through the Services (including the release of new tools and resources). Such new features shall also be deemed part of the Services and are subject to these Terms of Service. <br><br><strong>SECTION 8 - THIRD-PARTY LINKS</strong> <br>The Services may contain materials and hyperlinks to websites provided or operated by third parties (including any embedded third party functionality). We are not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party materials or websites you choose to access. If you decide to leave the Services to access these materials or third party sites, you do so at your own risk. <br>We are not liable for any harm or damages related to your access of any third-party websites, or your purchase or use of any products, services, resources, or content on any third-party websites. Please review carefully the third-party's policies and practices and make sure you understand them before you engage in any transaction.

We may control the defense and settlement of such claim at your expense, including choice of counsel, but will not settle any claim requiring non-monetary obligations from you without your consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). You will cooperate in the defense of indemnified claims, including by providing relevant documents. <br><br><strong>SECTION 18 - SEVERABILITY</strong> <br>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions. <br><br><strong>SECTION 19 - WAIVER; ENTIRE AGREEMENT</strong> <br>The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. <br>These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to the Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). <br>Any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Service shall not be construed against the drafting party. <br><br><strong>SECTION 20 - ASSIGNMENT</strong> <br>You may not delegate, transfer or assign this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent, and any such attempt will be null and void.
